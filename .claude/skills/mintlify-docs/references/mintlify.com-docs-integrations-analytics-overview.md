Track how users interact with your documentation by connecting to third-party analytics platforms. Mintlify sends engagement events to your configured analytics providers.

[​](#how-analytic-integrations-work)

How analytic integrations work

When you add analytics integrations to your documentation site, Mintlify tracks user interactions like page views, search queries, API playground requests, and feedback submissions and sends them to your analytics providers. You can connect any number of supported analytics providers by adding your API keys to the `docs.json` file. Analytics events flow to your providers as soon as you add them to your configuration with no further configuration required.

[​](#setup)

Setup

Add your analytics provider credentials to the `integrations` object in `docs.json`. Only include the platforms you want to use.

Analytics integrations only require public API keys, which are accessible to anyone viewing your documentation site. Your private API keys, which pair with the public keys on the analytics providers’ end, must remain private. Do not include private API keys in your `docs.json`.
