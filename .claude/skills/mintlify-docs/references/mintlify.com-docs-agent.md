The agent is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent) for anyone with access to your dashboard.

The agent creates pull requests with proposed changes to your documentation based on your prompts. When you send a request to the agent, it references your documentation, connected repositories, and Slack messages to create content that follows technical writing best practices and adheres to the Mintlify schema.

##

[​](#what-you-can-do-with-the-agent)

What you can do with the agent

Use the agent to:

- Write new content based on your prompts, links to pull requests, or Slack threads.
- Revise outdated code examples and API references.
- Search and update existing content.
- Answer questions about your docs and technical writing topics.
- Capture knowledge from Slack conversations and pull requests before it gets lost.
