This page explains different content types, when to use each one, and how to approach writing for each type.

Documentation should be organized around the specific goal you’re trying to help people achieve.

Categorize using the Diátaxis framework

The [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr) is a helpful guide for categorizing content based on your audience’s needs. Documentation can generally be mapped into one of these types:

1.  Tutorials: Learning-oriented content for new users
2.  How-to guides: Task-oriented guidance for specific problems
3.  Explanations: Understanding-oriented conceptual discussions
4.  Reference: Information-oriented technical descriptions

Defining content types helps you plan documentation with a clear purpose and makes it easier for users to find what they need.

[​](#picking-a-type)

Picking a type

| Question | Tutorial | How-To | Reference | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What is the user’s goal? | Learn through practice | Solve a specific problem | Find precise information | Understand concepts |
| What is the user’s knowledge? | Beginner | Intermediate | Experienced | Any level |
| What is the primary focus? | Learning by doing | Achieving a goal | Providing information | Deepening understanding |
| How is the content structured? | Step-by-step | Problem-solution | Organized facts | Conceptual discussions |
| Is it task-oriented? | Yes, guided tasks | Yes, specific tasks | No, informational | No, conceptual |
| Is it designed for linear progression? | Yes | No | No | No |

Writing for each type

###

[​](#tutorials-learning-oriented)

Tutorials (Learning-oriented)

- **Audience goal**: Learn something new through step-by-step instructions.
- **Characteristics**: Sequential and assumes no prior knowledge.
- **Writing approach**:
    -   Set expectations of what the user will achieve after reading.
    -   Use clear, incremental steps. Minimize choices that need to be made by the user.
    -   Point out milestones along the way.
    -   Minimize theory and focus on concrete actions.

###

[​](#how-to-guides-problem-oriented)

How-To Guides (Problem-oriented)

- **Audience goal**: Perform a specific task correctly.
- **Characteristics**: Goal-driven and assumes some prior knowledge.
- **Writing approach**:
    -   Write from the perspective of the user, not the product.
    -   Describe a logical sequence and omit unnecessary details.
    -   Minimize context beyond what is necessary.

###

[​](#reference-information-oriented)

Reference (Information-oriented)

- **Audience goal**: Find details about a product’s functionality.
- **Characteristics**: Unambiguous, product-focused, scannable.
- **Writing approach**:
    -   Be scannable and concise.
    -   Prioritize consistency.
    -   Avoid explanatory content. Focus on examples that are easy to copy and modify.

###

[​](#explanation-understanding-oriented)

Explanation (Understanding-oriented)

- **Audience goal**: Expand general understanding of a concept or highly complex feature.
- **Characteristics**: Theoretical, potentially opinionated, broad in scope.
- **Writing approach**:
    -   Provide background context, such as design decisions or technical constraints.
    -   Acknowledge opinions and alternatives.
    -   Draw connections to other areas in the product or industry.

[​](#tips-and-tricks)

Tips and tricks

1.  **Maintain purpose**: Before writing, assign each page a specific content type and make it top of mind in the doc throughout your writing.
2.  **Consider content freshness**: Regardless of content type, try to optimize for evergreen documentation. If something represents a moment in time of what a feature looks like on a specific date, it’s probably better suited for a changelog or blog post than in your documentation. Or if something changes very frequently avoid putting it in your docs.
3.  **Think like your users**: Consider different user personas when organizing content. See [Understand your audience](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/guides/understand-your-audience) for more information.
4.  **Use templates**: Start with [content templates](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/guides/content-templates) that provide the basic structure for each content type.

While the Diátaxis framework provides a starting point, successful documentation requires contextual adaptation to your product. Start by understanding the framework’s principles, then adjust them to serve your users’ needs.
