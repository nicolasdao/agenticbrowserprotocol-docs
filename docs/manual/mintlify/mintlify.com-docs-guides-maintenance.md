This page explains strategies for keeping your documentation accurate and valuable over time, from automated checks to content lifecycles.

##

[​](#automate-what-you-can)

Automate what you can

Introduce automations where you can, such as:

- **Track stale content:** Run a script to flag important docs that haven’t been updated in the last three months. Are they still accurate?
- **Automate documentation updates:** Build a workflow to automatically update documentation when code is merged with the [agent API](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/guides/automate-agent).
- **Enforce standards with linters:** Use [Vale](http://Vale.sh) or [CI checks](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/deploy/ci) to automatically catch formatting issues, writing style deviations, or missing metadata on every pull request.

##

[​](#set-up-a-review-process)

Set up a review process

Documentation might never be perfect, and that’s okay. You should have a threshold of acceptance where documentation is functional and useful. Balance efficiency with quality:

- **Focus on high-impact docs.** Not every page needs regular updates. Make sure the most important pages are reviewed regularly for accuracy and relevance.
- **Leverage your community.** If your docs are open-source, empower users to flag issues or submit fixes via pull requests. This builds trust and keeps content fresh.

##

[​](#know-when-to-rewrite)

Know when to rewrite

Over time, documentation naturally accumulates caveats and workarounds. When incremental fixes create more confusion than clarity, a full overhaul might be the best option.

- **Plan for periodic resets.** A major cleanup, especially if best practices or the product itself has evolved significantly, saves time for your team and your users.
- **Start with a structured audit.** Interview support teams, analyze user feedback, and document what is missing, misleading, or redundant before rewriting.
- **Complete rewrites in focused sprints.** A full overhaul doesn’t have to happen all at once. Prioritize sections with the biggest impact.

##

[​](#wrong-docs-can-be-worse-than-no-docs)

Wrong docs can be worse than no docs

Outdated or misleading documentation wastes users’ time and erodes trust. In cases where a page is completely inaccurate and unfixable in the short term, it’s often better to remove it entirely. Users will appreciate having less information over having wrong information.
