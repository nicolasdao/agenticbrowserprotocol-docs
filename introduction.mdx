The Agentic Browser Protocol (ABP) is an open specification that enables web applications and Chrome extensions to expose browser-exclusive capabilities — like PDF rendering, authenticated sessions, GPU-accelerated graphics, and privileged `chrome.*` APIs — to AI agents through direct API calls rather than fragile UI automation.

## What is ABP?

ABP inverts the traditional browser automation model. Instead of agents manipulating UI elements through CSS selectors, **applications expose a programmatic API** that agents call directly:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Traditional Automation
// Fragile, breaks when UI changes
await page.click('#copy-button');
await page.waitForSelector('.success-toast');
```

```javascript ABP
// Explicit contract, reliable
const result = await abp.call('convert.markdownToHtml', {
  markdown: '# Hello World\n\nThis is **bold** text.',
  options: { sanitize: true }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Why ABP?

Modern AI agents can read files, execute commands, and make HTTP requests, but certain capabilities remain inaccessible:

| Capability | Why Only Browsers Have It |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Canvas/WebGL/WebGPU rendering | Requires browser engine and GPU access |
| Authenticated sessions | User's cookies, localStorage, and OAuth tokens |
| On-device AI (Summarizer, Translator) | Chrome's built-in AI APIs run locally in the browser |
| Accurate HTML/CSS rendering | Only browsers render CSS correctly |
| PDF generation with CSS | Browser print engines produce vector PDFs with proper fonts |
| Chrome extension APIs | `chrome.tabs`, `chrome.scripting`, `chrome.bookmarks`, etc. only available to extensions |

ABP provides structured access to these browser-exclusive capabilities.

  <Card title="ABP Specification" icon="file-lines">
    A complete protocol specification defining how web applications expose capabilities to AI agents — session lifecycle, capability system, message formats, and discovery mechanism.

  <Card title="ABP MCP Bridge" icon="bridge">
    A reference implementation: a generic MCP server that connects any MCP-compatible AI agent to any ABP-compliant web application.

## Design Principles

1. **Browser as Runtime** — The browser is a capability provider, not a UI to manipulate
2. **Explicit Contracts** — All operations have defined inputs, outputs, and error conditions
3. **Progressive Enhancement** — Core features work everywhere; advanced features are opt-in
4. **Transport Agnostic** — Works over Puppeteer, postMessage, or WebSocket
5. **Future-Proof** — The capability system accommodates APIs that don't exist yet
6. **Bidirectional** — Apps can request information from agents, not just respond
7. **Observable** — Long operations report progress; state changes trigger notifications

## Relationship to MCP

ABP is **complementary to** the Model Context Protocol (MCP), not a replacement:

| Aspect | MCP | ABP |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Primary use case** | Build servers that give AI access to data and tools | Make web apps accessible to AI agents |
| **Deployment model** | Purpose-built server (local or remote) | Web application running in a browser |
| **Typical capabilities** | Databases, filesystems, APIs, external services | Browser-exclusive: PDF rendering, canvas, user sessions |

The ABP MCP Bridge is an MCP server that connects to ABP apps. Agents use MCP; the bridge translates to ABP.

## Use Cases

### For Web Developers

- Expose your app's features to AI agents — data visualization, document conversion, image processing, on-device AI, and more
- Make your SaaS app's features available programmatically without rebuilding an API
- Let agents leverage your app's authenticated sessions and user data

### For AI Agent Developers

- Access browser-exclusive capabilities (canvas/WebGPU rendering, authenticated sessions, on-device AI)
- Use the reference MCP Bridge implementation as a starting point
- Build specialized clients for specific ABP apps

### For Researchers & Experimenters

- Explore new ways to leverage browser capabilities in agentic workflows
- Prototype browser-AI interactions without reinventing infrastructure
- Build proof-of-concept integrations between existing web apps and agents

## Project Status
