| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ABP** | Agentic Browser Protocol |
| **ABP Manifest** | JSON file describing an app's ABP support and capabilities |
| **ABP Runtime** | App-side implementation exposed on `window.abp` |
| **ABP Client** | Any agent-side implementation for interacting with ABP apps |
| **AbortSignal** | Web standard for signaling cancellation, used by ABP for cancel support |
| **Agent** | AI system or CLI tool consuming ABP capabilities |
| **App** | Web application implementing ABP |
| **Base64** | Binary-to-text encoding used for binary data over WebSocket transport |
| **BinaryData** | Wrapper object for binary content with mimeType, encoding, and size metadata |
| **BinaryDataReference** | Reference to large binary content via downloadUrl instead of inline data |
| **Call ID** | Unique identifier for a capability call, used for cancellation |
| **Cancellation** | Aborting an in-progress operation before completion |
| **Capability** | Browser feature exposed through ABP |
| **Call** | Execute a capability (equivalent to MCP's `tools/call`) |
| **Contract** | The interface definition (manifest + `window.abp`) that ABP specifies, independent of any client implementation |
| **Discovery** | Process of determining if an app supports ABP and what it offers |
| **Elicitation** | App requesting input from agent (equivalent to MCP's elicitation) |
| **Headful Mode** | Browser launched with a visible window, required for full ABP capability access |
| **Manifest Link** | HTML `<link rel="abp-manifest">` tag pointing to the manifest |
| **MCP Bridge** | Recommended client architecture: a generic MCP server that translates ABP capabilities into MCP tools for AI agents |
| **Notification** | One-way message from app to agent |
| **Session** | Active connection between agent and app |
| **Transfer List** | postMessage feature for zero-copy ArrayBuffer transfer |
| **Transport** | Communication layer (Puppeteer, postMessage, WebSocket) used by a client implementation |
